## Abstracts
To analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market of banking institutions. The research group employed eleven different models, including ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX, Random Forest, Linear Regression, RNN, LSTM, BNN, GRU, XGBoost, and CNN-LSTM, to forecast the stock prices of three banks: VCB, BID, and STB. Three evaluation metrics, namely RMSE, MAPE, and MDA, were used to assess the performance of these models.

The results of the experiment revealed that out of the eleven models, the RNN and GRU models exhibited the best performance in terms of RMSE. For VCB stock, the RNN model achieved an RMSE of 1085.73, while the GRU model achieved an RMSE of 1420.37. Similarly, for STB stock, the RNN model achieved an RMSE of 873.23, and the GRU model achieved an RMSE of 926.10. Based on these findings, these two models were identified as the top performers.

The study emphasizes the effectiveness of the RNN and GRU models in accurately predicting stock prices, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the banking sector. The insights derived from these models can be valuable for investors and financial institutions in making informed decisions related to stock trading and portfolio management.
